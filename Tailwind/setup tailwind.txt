Tailwind setup
--------------

Step 1: Create a project folder

Step 2: Install npm necessary files
	npm init -y

Step 3: Installing tailwind CSS along with vite.js
	Run the following command on the terminal to install all the tailwind dependencies through vite.
	This command will create a node_modules folder and package-lock.json file.
	
	npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer vite

Step 4: Create Tailwind config file
		
	npx tailwindcss init -p

Step 5: Adding Tailwind directives

	Now, create a style.css file, and inside that file, add the layer directives of tailwind CSS.
	Once all the layer directives will be added in style.css, now, link the style.css 
	file into your HTML file using the <link> tag.
	
	@tailwind base;
	@tailwind components;
	@tailwind utilities;

Step 6: Updates in package.json

	We have created a package.json file (in step 2). This file contains important metadata about your project and records your dependencies. 

	“scripts”: {
   	“test”: “echo \”Error: no test specified\” && exit 1″
 	},

	Change the above lines of code with the lines below and don’t forget to add a comma at the end.

	“scripts”: {
   	“start”: “vite”
 	},

Step 7: Configure template paths
	
	We need to update the content in the tailwind.config.js file so that it will apply tailwind-CSS in all the files.
	Line to update

	content: ["*"],

Step 8: Check project structure
